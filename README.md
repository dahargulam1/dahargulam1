## About me
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dahar Gulam, a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I started my journey studying computer science and graduating in 2018 with a 2:2 degree. Although I initially pursued a different path, working in the patient transport service and supporting the community during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I've now decided to return to my roots and dive back into the world of software engineering.

## Skills and Projects

Since my transition back to software development, I have dedicated my time to enhancing my skills and working on various projects. Some of my notable achievements include:

**Bootcamp Experience:** I recently completed a comprehensive software engineering bootcamp where I honed my skills in python and SQL.
- **Project 1:**  simple calculator that enables users to perform basic arithmetic operations and read equations from a file. This project provided me with the opportunity to strengthen my skills in file handling, regular expressions, error handling, user input processing, string manipulation.
