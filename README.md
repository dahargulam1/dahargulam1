### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dahar Gulam, a dedicated software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions. I started my journey studying computer science and graduating in 2018 with a 2:2 degree. Although I initially pursued a different path, working in the patient transport service and supporting the community during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic, I've now decided to return to my roots and dive back into the world of software engineering.
